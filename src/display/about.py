The OPEN-MOE-LLM-LEADERBOARD is specifically designed to assess the performance and efficiency of various Mixture of Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative, driven by the open-source community, aims to comprehensively evaluate these advanced MoE LLMs. We extend our gratitude to the Huggingface for the GPU community grant that supported the initial debugging process, and to [NetMind.AI](https://netmind.ai/home) for their generous GPU donation, which ensures the continuous operation of the Leaderboard.
